Documentation of the layer regarding input weight and height to clarify how the input matrix is treated, especially if it is rectangular.

Say that I pass a matrix M(2744x100) to add, which I have obtained from "flattening" 100 images (or Mel cepstral coefficients, if we talk about speech, or whatever you like) of dimension 196x14. In other words, the first 196 columns of each row of M will be made of the 196 columns of the first row of each of the 100 images (or Mel cepstral coefficients). Then the next 295 columns of M (196 - 393) will be made of the 196 columns of the second row of the 100 images (or Mel cepstral coefficients), etc. I want my input to be 196x14 for , so my add will be something like this:

model.Add<Convolution<>>(1, // Number of input activation maps.
14, // Number of output activation maps.
3, // Filter width.
3, // Filter height.
1, // Stride along width.
1, // Stride along height.
0, // Padding width.
0, // Padding height.
196, // Input width.
14 // Input height.
);

By doing so, will recreate the original 196x14 matrix for each image (or Mel cepstral coefficients) that will be used as input for the 14 filters of this example.
